# Calculator-Project year: 2013-
This is my final project for MATLAB programing course in 2013
MATLAB Scientific Calculator GUI
Project Overview
This MATLAB-based Graphical User Interface (GUI) is a scientific calculator designed to perform a wide range of mathematical operations, including arithmetic, trigonometric, logarithmic, matrix, and polynomial calculations. The GUI is user-friendly and provides a convenient way to perform complex computations interactively.

**Features**
Basic Arithmetic Operations: Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

**Advanced Functions:**

Trigonometric functions (sin, cos, tan, cot, asin, acos, atan, acot).

Hyperbolic functions (sinh, cosh, tanh, coth).

Logarithmic functions (log, log10, log2).

Exponential and power functions (exp, sqrt, ^).

Factorial and prime number calculations.

Matrix and Polynomial Operations:

Polynomial integration and differentiation.

Roots of polynomials.

Matrix operations (e.g., gcd, lcm, mod, rem).

Memory Functions: Store and recall up to 5 values.

Customizable Interface: Change the background color of the calculator.

Real-Time Calculations: Perform calculations and display results instantly.

**Requirements**
MATLAB R2013a or later (since the code uses str2double and other modern functions).

No additional toolboxes are required.

**Installation**
Clone or download this repository to your local machine.

Open MATLAB and navigate to the project directory.

Run the main file projecta.m to launch the calculator.

```matlab
>> run projecta.m
```

**Usage**
Basic Calculations:

Use the number buttons (0-9) and arithmetic operators (+, -, *, /) to perform calculations.

Press the = button to compute the result.

Advanced Functions:

Use the dedicated buttons for trigonometric, logarithmic, and other advanced functions.

For example, click sin to calculate the sine of a number.

Memory Operations:

Store values in memory using the M1 to M5 buttons.

Recall stored values by clicking the corresponding memory button.

**Customization:**

Change the background color of the calculator using the Color menu.

Polynomial and Matrix Operations:

Use the poly, roots, polyint, and polyder buttons for polynomial operations.

Use the gcd, lcm, mod, and rem buttons for matrix operations.
